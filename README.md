Description:
Developed a comprehensive web application using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technologies called "Candidate Assessment OCEAN Model." The project aimed to provide an efficient and data-driven solution for assessing candidates' personality traits based on the OCEAN model (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism).

Key Contributions:

Designed and implemented the backend using JDBC to establish a secure and reliable connection with the database, enabling seamless data retrieval and storage.
Utilized JSP to create dynamic web pages that allowed users to input candidate assessment data and obtain detailed personality analysis.
Integrated OCEAN model algorithms to analyze assessment responses and generate personalized reports with insights into each candidate's personality traits.
Implemented robust data validation and error handling mechanisms to ensure data accuracy and prevent unauthorized access.
Collaborated with a team of developers to brainstorm ideas, divide tasks, and deliver the project within tight timelines.

Technologies Used:
Java, JDBC, JSP, HTML, CSS, MySQL, OCEAN model algorithms.

Outcome:
The "Candidate Assessment OCEAN Model" project successfully provided a user-friendly platform for evaluating candidates' personalities, leading to more informed hiring decisions. The application received positive feedback from users for its accuracy, efficiency, and intuitive interface.
